🎬 IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis 🎭




🚀 Overview
This project analyzes sentiment in IMDb movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights into audience reception.

📌 Features
✔ Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization
✔ Feature Engineering: TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
✔ Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
✔ Deep Learning Approach: LSTM-based sentiment classifier
✔ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
✔ Deployment: Interactive web app using Flask/Streamlit (optional)

📂 Dataset
